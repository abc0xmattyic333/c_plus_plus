// What is C++?

/*
C++ is used to create computer programs, and is one of the most used language in game development.

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.

// Why use C++?

/*
C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's), and embedded systems.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

// Difference between C and C++??

/*
C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

// Let's get started:

// This tutorial aims to teach you the basics of C++.

// Whenever we are finished with this tutorial, you will be able to write C++ programs and create real-life examples.

// Note: This tutorial doesn't require any prior programming experience. :)

/*
To start using C++ we need a text editor. 
By using vscode.dev as a homescreen application on my iPhone 14 Pro Max, I can connect to remote repositories that I created on my Github account.
You can visit my Github account at the following link:(https://github.com/abc0xmattyic333)
*/

// Let's create our first C++ file

// In your editor of your choose create your first C++ program by making a file named MyFirstCppProgram.cpp

// Write the following code below:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}

// Don't worry if you don't understand the above code right now. 

// We will go further in detail in later chapters of this course.

// If you vist our assets folder you can see a png file that shows the output of the code example above.

// Congratulations! You have just witten your first C++ program. :)

// I told you that you would become a C++ developer. ;p
