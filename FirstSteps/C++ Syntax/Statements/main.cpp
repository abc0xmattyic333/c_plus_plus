// C++ Statements

/*
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Hello World" to the screen:
*/

cout << "Hello, World!";

// It is important that you end a statement with a semicolon ;.

// If you forget the semicolon, it will cause an error and your program won't run.


// Many Statements

// Most C++ programs contain many statements.

// The statements are executed, one by one, in the order that they are written in.

cout << "Hello, World!";
cout << "Have a good day!;

return 0;
